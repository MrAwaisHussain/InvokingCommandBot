## InvokingCommandBot

This is a simple bot that remove the invoking command.

*Not super useful but it fulfils a purpose rather than a certain few bots that charge premium for this*

###### If this bot develops any more functionality. I'll probably update this later.

### How to:
## Requirements:
- `Node`
## Setup:
1. Download/Clone the Repo (Lets be honest, theres not much to copy paste if you really wanted to)
2. Grab your `BOT TOKEN` and replace `INSERT TOKEN HERE` [Line 24]
3. Grab your `ID` and replace `OWNERID` [Line 3]
    - If you want to, Grab the BOT invite link and replace `INSERT BOT INVITE LINK HERE` [Line 20]
4. `cd` into the directory and run `npm install discord.js`
5. Run the bot using `node yikers.js` (or if you renamed it `node filename.js`)
6. Profit?
